### Summary

With over 9 years in IT, I’ve grown from backend web development into a DevOps and cloud engineering specialist. 
My expertise centers on AWS infrastructure (Terraform), CI/CD pipeline development, and building scalable, 
reliable systems for microservices architectures.

Currently, I design and implement DR strategies, migrate AWS resources between VPCs, and maintain CI/CD pipelines for 
PHP and JS microservices. I’ve contributed to the transition from Octopus Deploy to Harness, built multi-region 
data ingestion pipelines with AWS Kinesis, Lambda, and S3, and fine-tuned Datadog monitoring for cloud environments.

Certified as an [AWS DevOps Engineer – Professional](https://www.credly.com/badges/7da1a846-48b8-4e3b-b774-d44357e3a465/public_url) 
and [HashiCorp Terraform Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/4c9a73ff-4aa2-45f0-b77f-589df6501524/public_url), 
I’m also a graduate of the Data Engineering certification program at Ukrainian Catholic University. 
I’m passionate about leveraging LLMs for engineering excellence and actively share knowledge within professional communities.

Key strengths:
- AWS & Cloud Solutions
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- CI/CD & Automation
- Microservices & Data Engineering
- Community Engagement & Mentoring
